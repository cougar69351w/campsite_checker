# campsite_checker

A configureable script that allows a person to check for availability of a campsite that's reservable on www.recreation.gov.

This script is fairly extensible, in that all you need to do is create a function to perform the needed browser actions required to detect availability.

Future iterations may include the ability to reserve an available spot.

# permit_checker

A script that allows a person to check for availability of a permit that's reservable on www.recreation.gov. At some point this will be moved under campsite_checker.
